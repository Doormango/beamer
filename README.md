# Beamer Template

This repo contains the template from which I create presentations in Beamer, including theme,
color palette, and build config.

## Make targets

The following GNU Make targets are supported:
- `all`: default target; build presentation
- `bg`: background compilation; watch files & recompile on changes
- `clean`: delete compilation artifacts
- `install`: place .tar.gz compressed version of this repo in ~/Templates
